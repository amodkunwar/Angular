Routing - Strategy : 

1. Before, we begin implementation our routes in applications, its important to plan, architect the routes.
2. How, what and where are the questions to be asked in this stage.
3. This is called "Routing Strategy".
4. This is extremely important as it will affect the entire application flow and navigation.
	- /products
	- /product/10
	- /product/10/details
	- /product?search=param1
5. Anulgar provides 2 types of Roting stategy we can use :
	- PathLocationStrategy
	- HashLocationStrategy
6. We need to add this in Provider of our Modul.
	- {provide: LocationStrategy, useClass: HashLocationStrategy}
7. By default - Angular makes use of the PathLocationStrategy
8. With HashLocationStrategy - we will see the # in the URL.

PathLocationStrategy : 
	- /products
	- /product/10
	- /product/10/details
	- /product?search=param1
	
HashLocationStrategy : 
	- #/products
	- #/product/10
	- #/product/10/details
	- #/product?search=param1
	
 providers: [
    {provide : LocationStrategy, useClass : HashLocationStrategy}
  ],
  
 or
 
  providers: [
    {provide : LocationStrategy, useClass : PathLocationStrategy}
  ],
