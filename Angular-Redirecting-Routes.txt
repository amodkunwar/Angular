Routing - Redirecting Routes :

1. When we want to route to be redirected to another route - we will implement the redirectTo in our route array.
2. The syntax to define the same is given below : 
	- { path: '', redirectTo: 'home', pathMatch:'full' },
3. The empty path indicates that it's the default route of the application.
4. The empty path also requires us to mention that pathMatch should be full.


	const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', redirectTo: 'product-edit', pathMatch:'full' },
  { path: 'learning', component: TasksComponent },
  { path: 'products', component: ProductsComponent },
  { path: 'product-view', component: ProductviewComponent },
  { path: 'product-edit', component: ProducteditComponent },
  { path: 'product-id/:id1/:id2', component: ProductIdComponent },
  {path: 'search', component: SearchComponent}
	];
