Routing - Wildcard Routes : 

1. wild card intercepts any invalid URLs in our application.
2. When NO matching routes are found in the routes array, the router does not know where to go and hence results in console errors.
3. Wild card routes are defined in the routes array using.
	- {path: '**'}
4. Usually a component name PageNotFound is mapped as best practice.

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: '', redirectTo: 'product-edit', pathMatch:'full' },
  { path: 'learning', component: TasksComponent },
  { path: 'products', component: ProductsComponent },
  { path: 'product-view', component: ProductviewComponent },
  { path: 'product-edit', component: ProducteditComponent },
  { path: 'product-id/:id1/:id2', component: ProductIdComponent },
  {path: 'search', component: SearchComponent},
  {path: '**', component: PageNotFoundComponent}
];
